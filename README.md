Inspired from a recent post about a weekend project of Mike William - ArtBot and a free weekend, i started with what I had in mind from quite a time.

I wanted to create a very basic FB chatbot based on Zomato API which does only 1 task for now, steps goes as follows:
a. Provide your location,
b. Select the collection you would like to explore
c. Choose the restaurant and read reviews,
d. Make a call to reserve your table. or try and check another restaurant. 

I thought of working with API.ai first but then moved to ChatFuel, never worked with CF so was quite excited. I liked the user interface and documentation provided by team and also the ease of integration with FB.
Other technologies, used are Heroku to deploy and Python to create RESTApi services.

Overall personally quite happy with the output given the limited time, it really helped me focusing on the problem and exploring some new things.

Feel free to drop a message or comment here in case of any feedback, I would love to hear some.


Also credit to VikramjitRoy for the Zomato Python wrapper, it helped me focus more on the chatbot rather than creating a wrapper.
